## NeuroChat Frontend - How to Run

### How to Run Locally:

1.  **Ensure Backend is Running:** The NeuroChat backend server must be running on `http://localhost:12000`.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

The frontend will automatically start and connect to the backend for a seamless chat experience.
